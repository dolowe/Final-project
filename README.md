# Final-project

The final project deals with energy consumption and CO2 emissions in production. The prediction of
building energy consumption is very important in improving the energy consumption. 
To prevent dangerous climate change, the EU has pledged to bring about climate neutrality by 2050. 
In turn this will be achieved through agreed national emission and intercompany targets. 
To support the goals, several models are evaluated on their best fit.

All steps of the  project were planned and visualised in
